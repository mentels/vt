## TatraVelo El Clásico 1/5: Zakopane - Bešeňová

The route will take you through three regions: Polish Podhale, Slovak Orava and Liptov, where it ends. Today will give you a taste of everything you can find on Tatravelo; starts with a demanding ascent up to Gubałówka (you can ride a funicular instead), then a long descent and almost flat section with great views on the Tatras from the “official” Cycling Route Around the Tatras. Then two long woody ascents after Oravice and Zuberec before plunging into the narrow Kvačanská Valley when some careful balancing will be necessary. The last section is a beautiful open space with fields around until arriving at stunning Liptov Lake. Plus relaxing baths in Bešeňová thermal waters in the evening, if you wish.

There is some culture and history as well - interesting wooden villages of Chochołów (UNESCO) and Huty, surprising relic mills in Kvačanská /detour/ and alone-standing tower at Liptov Lake, the only remnant after once an important church and village; architecture fans can add Zuberec Orava Village museum or Havrávok Celtic Archeological Museum.

Diverse surfaces, ascents, descents, flat sections… a Sub-Tatra goulash :-)

Highlights:

* Chochołów - this wooden village is one of the finest examples of wooden architecture on the whole route.

* Former Trstená - Nowy Targ railway - today a cycleway but once a track that would unite or divide two neighbouring lands. You’ll learn some history here.

* Oravice and Zuberec uphills - these green forest sections will test your persistence. But remember - once you climb up, it means there is a downhill ahead!

* Kvačanská Valley + the Mills - well, it’s not the comfiest road but the landscape of a deep green valley and the hidden mills /detour/ are a great reward for the bumps. A must-see secret place.

* Liptov Lake - whether you start or finish here, you can’t stop taking a break to contemplate the tranquil waters of the Lake reflecting the surrounding mountains and the clouds.

| Start:   | Finish:  | Length: | Ascent: | Descent: | Time:  | Av. speed: |
| Zakopane | Bešeňová | 89.8 km | 1150 m  | 1470 m   | 6:05 h | 14.8 km/h  |

## Day 2: The sunny side (planned)

Liptov - the sunny side of the Tatras. Well, total ascent for today might not seem that innocent - 1190 m up, but look at the elevation profile. Believe us, the views will make you forget you’re even cycling up. Fields, secondary roads, lake views… magnificent views for all the mountains around. It’s also time to learn some history of Slovakia today. If you’re a history fan, you’ll have more to discover: an ancient fortress, open air museum at Pribylina, Liptovský Mikuláš historical centre and impressive Okolične church.

At the beginning we pass by the Liptov Lake - it’s a different place in the morning. Then some scenic local roads cycling through the fields before arriving at Mikuláš. Afterwards, you'll have to focus while riding some unpaved roads along Váh River Valley, through Liptovský Jan, Podtureň and Liptovský Hradok. The last part (a half, actually!) of the route is a 40 km, 800m ascent. But don’t think it’s boring. Ever changing 360º panoramas before immersing in thick forest and ending up above it, by Štrbské Lake, 1350 m above sea level is a great experience.

Highlights:

* Liptov Lake - it will be the dominant of all the views in the first stage of the route.
* Liptovský Mikuláš - a charming town, a place to learn what Slovakia, Czechia and Hungary have in common… or don’t have. Local Robin Hood stories and, of course, … Santa Claus!
* Liptovský Ján - and what about… getting off your bike to rest your legs in a free, outdoor thermal pool, just by the road? They’ve been doing it for ages here!
* Views, views, views! Liptovská Kokava - a looong ascent… but once you reach the end, you regret it’s not longer!
* Śtrbské Pleso - you’d better grab some warm clothes, you’re up in the mountains. And grab your camera, too. You’re at an Alpine lake. Take your time to contemplate.

## Day 3: The land of 7 cultures (v1)

It’s going to be an enjoyable day in Spiš region. Great downhills and gentle uphills (only 590m up today!). Until 1945 it was a true melting pot: Saxon-Germans, Slovaks, Hungarian, Gypsies, Jews and Poles; a mix of cultures, languages, religions, mentalities. Nowadays, sadly, it's not what it used to be however the rich heritage remained - Poprad and Kežmarok are undoubtedly the most interesting towns of the whole route. We will go far from Tatras, taste amazing and diverse views, but will end up by their feet again.

Yesterday it was an uphill day, so today you get your reward - a long downhill and… some uphill at the end of the day :). Again lots of views, first following Freedom Road, above the forests limit, then a spectacular downhill till you reach River Poprad banks that lead you to Poprad city - “five towns in one”. Out of Poprad some great views from Low Tatras foothills and another amazing scenic cycleway until arriving at Kežmarok. The day ends with a green ascent up to Tatranská Lomnica and we're back right by the Tatras, again.

Highlights:

* Freedom Road (Cesta Slobody) - cycling over the forest zone limit. Prime views and a great downhill afterwards.

* Poprad River Cycleway - lazy cycling with great views around.

* Poprad and Kežmarok towns - undoubtedly the most interesting historic towns on the whole route. Take your time to get to know their charm and monuments.

* Poprad To Kežmarok part - prime cycling through the fields, hills and old villages with the mountains looming on the horizon.

## 4/5: Through the depths of the valleys

Today you will see different kinds of mountains thatthere are in Tatra regions. We will stay in Spiš (partly Slovakia, partly Poland today) but the landscapes will change dramatically during the day. It’s mostly you, the road and the nature today. Some interesting wooden villages - Ždiar and Osturňa (a Rusinian enclave) with and an... Orthodox church! Further, already in Polish Spisz, an intriguing story of Incas at Niedzica Castle and Lake (detour), the flying monk stories of Červený Klaštor Monastery and the jewel in the crown - Dunajec River Gorge.

Highlights:

* Freedom Road (Cesta Slobody) - great views from above the forests.

* Osturňa Valley - a perfect downhill, followed by a lost in time Rusinian village. Check the local bar to try some Czechoslovakia times.
* Sromowce Lake (and Niedzica Castle detour) - Inca secrets by a beautiful lake in Pieniny.
* Dunajec River Gorge - the best river section on TatraVelo route plus an uphill and a nice scenic downhill to end the day the best we can.

Be the Freedom Road (Cesta Slobody) we arrive at Kotlina, where a long 350m ascent begins, through a deep and narrow valley. It takes us up to 1150m, with a unique view of the Belanské Tatry. Then, one of the best descents: down a thick forest, along a stream takes us to “end-of-the-world” village of Osturňa and to Poland. Niedzica Lake - you can pick the Castle detour here. We continue to Sromowce.  It could end here (55km), but  Dunajec River Gorge Lesnica and Haligovce area ahead. If you’re tired, take a break, leave your staff in Sromowce, but don’t miss Dunajec Gorge… it’s one of the jewels in the crown.

## Day 5/5: The Last Landscape of Tatras

All things come to an end… but before that, we make sure you sweat it well :-). We will keep away from the main roads to see there is a lot to discover - a village at the top of a mountain (Dursztyn), UNESCO wooden church of Dębno, a surprisingly charming cycling by Velo Dunajec River section… we’ll jump in the middle of THE city, as the locals call Nowy Targ, but afterwards, through a purgatory of Ludźmierz Shrine and a looong ascent we will clean our minds well. Wide panoramas today, to make you forget your fatigued muscles.

Up the valley we arrive in Dursztyn, where we enjoy the views and the new cycleway. Scenic local roads take us back to Dunajec River and Czorsztyńskie Lake. Velo Dunajec cycleway brings us, following up the river, to Nowy Targ, the capital city of Podhale with some tasty ice cream. After refreshing at Ludźmierz Shrine well, we start the last, 22 km long, ever facing Tatra, rugged ascent. It will be a great challenge at some sections, let the views ease your pain. Remember, once you make it up to Gubałówka, you’ve done it!

Highlights:

* Tatra Cycleway Dursztyn Section - a dedicated cycleway in the middle of a rural scenic landscapes.
* Velo Dunajec Section - technical, green, through some authentic Podhale villages.
* Nowy Targ local ice cream - we cycle, so we need sugar. A perfect excuse for one more scoop.
* Maruszyna - Gubałówka - the ultimate ascent and the reward: crazy downhill to Zakopane.
