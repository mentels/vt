## What do we do?

TatraVelo aims to promote a small sub-Tatra region as a cycling tourism destination. Small in size, though extremely rich in history, culture, beautiful landscapes and adventure. It's also about the challenge: to RIDE A LOOP AROUND the TATRAS BY BIKE, against the uphills and downhills, the wind and maybe rain, your fatigue and body.

To make it easy for you to face the challenge and explore the region with a bike we do our best to provide you with comprehensive information. At TatraVelo you will find a complete route divided into day stages. Each stage contains not only a detailed map (with elevation profile, surface type etc.) but is also accompanied by a rich description of the most attractive places.

The day stages are kept on Komoot. It allows you to have the map and GPS track at hand
while you're cycling. Komoot features also a useful and effective voice navigation.
## Why do we do what we do?

2 countries. 4 regions. Heritage of 7 cultures. Dozens of monuments and interesting places. Hundreds kilometers of cycle routes. Countless views, countless memories.

It’s hard to find another place like here. In a relatively small area you can find a great variety of interesting places and stories. A land of various influences, rich history, impressive geography… a heaven for a cycle tourism passionate. However, don’t think it’s cycling the Danube valley, we’re in the mountains - and the mountains are what gives the unique taste of TatraVelo. Sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter or spicy, always unique.
At one moment we’re right by an Alpine lake, to be riding a pleasant riverside cycleway an hour later, visit a Medieval town afterwards to cycle a lost road in the middle of fields at the end. The emotions are intense and the landscapes are ever-changing.
And so is the effort. An average of 80 km and 1000 m ascent per day means it’s a serious cycling, too. We deliver one, almost 100% paved route by now, but are working on an MTB and a strictly road bike one.

Our passion for this region was not a love at first sight. Many Polish cyclists do a one-day loop or a two-day (challenge) loop around the Tatras. In their case it’s just about the loop. For us, the more times we came, the more we discovered to finally understand there is  more to it than just the road. We want to share this passion with you.
