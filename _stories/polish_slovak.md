How would you feel if your country exchanged your village for another one with a neighbouring country?

Well, this is the case of Suchá Hora and Hladovka. When it comes to nationality, until the First World War people from here were… basically people from here, they didn’t need to define themselves as Slovaks or Polish. In 1918, independent Czechoslovakia was created and Poland was recreated so the time to set the borders came. Sub-Tatra regions used to be multinational (Polish, Slovak, Saxon, Hungarian, Jewish, Gipsy, Ruthenians, others), but in some areas they didn’t have any national identification.

After WW1 both Polish and Slovak were trying to rise the national feelings in the local population and a survey was to be conveyed to let the people decide. Finally however, in 1921, an international committee designed the borders. Suchá Hora and Hladovka were to be within the Polish country, but 3 years later the countries decided to exchange them for other villages and the nowadays borders are the same today. You can find the same surnames on both sides of the border, many times people have their relatives in PL or SK.
