## TatraVelo El Clásico 1/5: Zakopane - Bešeňová

The route will take you through three regions: Polish Podhale, Slovak Orava and Liptov, where it ends. Today will give you a taste of everything you can find on Tatravelo; starts with a demanding ascent up to Gubałówka (you can ride a funicular instead), then a long descent and almost flat section with great views on the Tatras from the “official” Cycling Route Around the Tatras. Then two long woody ascents after Oravice and Zuberec before plunging into the narrow Kvačanská Valley when some careful balancing will be necessary. The last section is a beautiful open space with fields around until arriving at stunning Liptov Lake. Plus relaxing baths in Bešeňová thermal waters in the evening, if you wish.

There is some culture and history as well - interesting wooden villages of Chochołów (UNESCO) and Huty, surprising relic mills in Kvačanská /detour/ and alone-standing tower at Liptov Lake, the only remnant after once an important church and village; architecture fans can add Zuberec Orava Village museum or Havrávok Celtic Archeological Museum.

Diverse surfaces, ascents, descents, flat sections… a Sub-Tatra goulash :-)

Highlights:

* Chochołów - this wooden village is one of the finest examples of wooden architecture on the whole route.

* Former Trstená - Nowy Targ railway - today a cycleway but once a track that would unite or divide two neighbouring lands. You’ll learn some history here.

* Oravice and Zuberec uphills - these green forest sections will test your persistence. But remember - once you climb up, it means there is a downhill ahead!

* Kvačanská Valley + the Mills - well, it’s not the comfiest road but the landscape of a deep green valley and the hidden mills /detour/ are a great reward for the bumps. A must-see secret place.

* Liptov Lake - whether you start or finish here, you can’t stop taking a break to contemplate the tranquil waters of the Lake reflecting the surrounding mountains and the clouds.

## Day 2: The sunny side

#### From Bešeňová to Štrbské Pleso

---

Liptov - the sunny side of the Tatras. Well, total ascent for today might not seem that innocent - 1190 m up, but look at the elevation profile. Believe us, the views will make you forget you’re even cycling up. Fields, secondary roads, lake views… magnificent views for all the mountains around. It’s also time to learn some history of Slovakia today. If you’re a history fan, you’ll have more to discover: an ancient fortress, open air museum at Pribylina, Liptovský Mikuláš historical centre and impressive Okolične church.

At the beginning we pass by the Liptov Lake - it’s a different place in the morning. Then some scenic local roads cycling through the fields before arriving at Mikuláš. Afterwards, you'll have to focus while riding some unpaved roads along Váh River Valley, through Lipt. Jan, Podtureň and Lipt. Hradok. The last part (a half, actually!) of the route is a 40 km, 800 m ascent. But don’t think it’s boring. Ever changing 360º panoramas before immersing in thick forest and ending up above it, by Štrbské Lake, 1350 m above sea level.

Highlights:

* Liptov Lake - it will be the dominant of all the views in the first stage of the route.

* Liptovský Mikuláš - a charming town, a place to learn what Slovakia, Czechia and Hungary have in common… or don’t have. Local Robin Hood stories and, of course, … Santa Claus!

* Liptovský Ján - and what about… getting off your bike to rest your legs in a free, outdoor thermal pool, just by the road? They’ve been doing it for ages here!

* Views, views, views! Liptovská Kokava - a looong ascent… but once you reach the end, you regret its not longer!

* Śtrbské Pleso - you’d better grab some warm clothes, you’re up in the mountains. And grab your camera, too. You’re at an Alpine lake. Take your time to contemplate.
