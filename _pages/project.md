## What do we do?

TatraVelo aims to promote a small sub-Tatra region as a cycling tourism destination. Small in size, though extremely rich in history, culture and beautiful landscapes and adventure. Not only that, but most importantly for a bike traveler:

To make it easy for you to explore the region surrounding Tatras we we do our best to provide you with a complete bike route divided into stages along with descriptions of the best worth visiting places. Not only that, but we maintain these routes in a Komoot service that allows you to navigate using your mobile device.
